# Type-of-Ghosts-Sense.Hat-Python
Do you want to be able to identify different type of ghosts? This code is exactly for that. Copy the code and paste it in trinket.io/sense-hat. 

This code made in Python is about a machine used by the Ghostbusters in order to identify different type of ghosts! 

In order to get it ready to work you will just need to click the "Run" button in trinket. This will show a "searching" message, which means that it is looking for ghosts. Ghosts are different based on three properties: Temperature, pressure, and humidity. You will need to change the values of these three sliders in order to find different ghosts.

Types of ghosts:

1. Fantasma.-     The most basic type of ghost, it will not hurt you. 
                  Temperature: from -40 to 32. Pressure: from 260 to 450. Humidity: from 0 to 20.
                  
2. Interactive.-  The playful ghost. He just wants to have fun spooking around.
                  Temperature: from 32 to 65. Pressure: from 450 to 600. Humidity: from 21 to 40.
                  
3. Ectoplasm.-    The electric ghost. Do not get near him or you will be electrocuted.
                  Temperature: from 65 to 80. Pressure: from 600 to 800. Humidity: from 40 to 60.
                  
4. Poltergeist.-  The scary ghost. He will try and hurt you with sharp objects. 
                  Temperature: from 80 to 85. Pressure: from 800 to 1000. Humidity: from 60 to 80.
                  
5. Orbs.-         The energy ghost. He will not do anything, you will just feel his presence. 
                  Temperature: from 85 to 105. Pressure: from 1000 to 1100. Humidity: from 80 to 90.
                  
6. Funnel.-       This ghost will leave you temporarily speaking with a high-pitch voice.
                  Temperature: from 105 to 120. Pressure: from 1100 to 1260. Humidity: from 90 to 100.
